## About Me
I build reliable, secure, and data-driven software that solves real problems. I work across the whole stack — from backend systems and ML pipelines to polished frontend experiences — and I care deeply about security, privacy, and cryptographic principles in production systems.

- 🔭 I’m currently building: secure data platforms, ML-based risk models, and end-to-end web apps
- 🌱 I’m learning: advanced applied cryptography, federated learning, and privacy-preserving ML
- ⚡ Interests: cryptography, applied finance, secure architectures, adversarial ML

## How I Work
- Design systems with security and observability from day one.
- Prefer incremental delivery: from prototype → tests → hardened production.
- Use automated tests, type systems, and CI to keep quality high.
- Document decisions: why a design was chosen and what trade-offs exist.

---

## Open to
- Collaborations on secure fintech, privacy-preserving ML, and crypto research
- Contract or full-time roles involving full-stack + ML + security
